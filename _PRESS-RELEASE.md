## Heading ##
  > PokémonTracker

## Sub-Heading ##
  > This is for all the pokémon trainers in the world today whose goal is to "catch'em all!" or simply for those who need a bit more organization.

## Summary ##
  > This fantasic app will allow the trainer to keep tabs on what pokémons they own. They simply enter the pokémon name and with a click of a button, that pokémon is saved! Easy! It also lets you see the basic details of other pokémon that is yet to be captured.

## Problem ##
  > Often times trainers need to go in and out of their in-game pokédex to check out what pokémons they have. That's a lot of maneuvering of the user interface. No more! 

## Solution ##
  > This will simply display all trainer's pokémon to the browser at a moments notice. Favoriting the app will speed things along even faster.

## How to Get Started ##
  > When you first start your grand adventure you can simply open the app and enter their names. They will appear before you! Next, simply click "add" to add them to your caught collection. Perhaps you want to set your friend free later on. Call on their name and click "remove."
